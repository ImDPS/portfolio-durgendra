# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build fast, SEO-friendly, and user-friendly web applications. In this post, we'll explore the basics of getting started with Next.js and why it's a great choice for your next project.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over a plain React application:

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** - Improves performance and SEO
- **Static site generation (SSG)** - Pre-renders pages at build time for even faster loading
- **File-based routing** - Simplifies navigation structure
- **API Routes** - Build API endpoints within your Next.js app
- **Image Optimization** - Automatic image optimization with the `Image` component
- **Zero Config** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward. Here's how you can create your first project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project and start the development server. You can access your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Understanding the File Structure

Next.js uses a file-based routing system. The pages in your application are determined by the files in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory if you're using the App Router).

```
my-next-app/
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── index.js     # Home page (/)
  │   ├── about.js     # About page (/about)
  │   └── posts/
  │       ├── index.js # Posts page (/posts)
  │       └── [id].js  # Dynamic post page (/posts/123)
  ├── public/          # Static assets
  ├── styles/          # CSS files
  └── components/      # React components
```

With Next.js 13+, you can also use the new App Router with the `app` directory:

```
my-next-app/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── page.tsx        # Home page (/)
  │   ├── about/
  │   │   └── page.tsx    # About page (/about)
  │   └── posts/
  │       ├── page.tsx    # Posts page (/posts)
  │       └── [id]/
  │           └── page.tsx # Dynamic post page (/posts/123)
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data for your pages:

### getStaticProps (Static Site Generation)

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  
  return {
    props: { data }, // Will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

### getServerSideProps (Server-side Rendering)

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  
  return {
    props: { data }, // Will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a powerful framework for building modern web applications with React. Its built-in features for performance optimization, routing, and server-side rendering make it an excellent choice for both small and large-scale projects.

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced Next.js features such as API routes, image optimization, and internationalization.

Happy coding!
