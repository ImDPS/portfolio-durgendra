# UI/UX Design Guidelines

## Design System

### Colors
- Primary: Technical blue (#0070F3) with 10 shade variants
- Secondary: Accent color for highlights (#FF4D8F) with variants
- Neutrals: 12 grayscale colors from white to black
- Semantic: Success, warning, error, and info colors with variants
- Theme-specific: Different accent colors for light and dark themes

### Typography
- Headings: Modern sans-serif (e.g., Satoshi, Inter, or custom font)
- Body: Readable sans-serif with good legibility
- Code: Monospace font for code snippets (e.g., JetBrains Mono)
- Scale: Type scale with 8px base (12px, 14px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Line heights: 1.1 for headings, 1.5 for body text

### Spacing
- Base 8px spacing system (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px, 128px)
- Consistent spacing between sections and components
- Breathing room around important elements

### Iconography
- Consistent icon set (custom or from libraries like Phosphor, Lucide)
- Icon animations on hover/interaction
- Icon sizing based on typography scale

## UI Components
- Buttons: Several variants (primary, secondary, ghost, link)
- Cards: Project cards, info cards with consistent styling
- Navigation: Animated, responsive navigation system
- Forms: Styled form elements with validation states
- Loaders: Custom animated loaders that match the design language

## Microinteractions
- Subtle hover effects on interactive elements
- Focus states that are both accessible and attractive
- Loading states with custom animations
- Success/error feedback animations
- Page transition effects

## Motion Design Principles
- Natural, physics-based animations (ease, spring)
- Purposeful motion that guides the user
- Cohesive animation language across components
- Performance-conscious animations
- Respect for reduced motion preferences

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px - 639px
  - Tablet: 640px - 1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px - 1399px
  - Large desktop: 1400px+
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Optimized touch targets for mobile
- Different animation strategies for different devices
