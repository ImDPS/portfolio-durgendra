# 3D Implementation Guide

## Three.js Setup
### Core Experience Management
- Central Canvas provider component
- Scene management system
- Camera controls and configuration
- Lighting setup with theme integration

## React Three Fiber Integration
```jsx
// Sample Canvas Provider
export const ThreeCanvas: React.FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Canvas
      camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 45 }}
      dpr={[1, 2]}
      gl={{ 
        antialias: true,
        toneMapping: THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping
      }}
    >
      <ThemeAwareLighting />
      <OrbitControls enableZoom={false} />
      {children}
      <EffectsComposer />
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```

## Performance Optimization
- Instancing for repeated elements
- Level-of-detail (LOD) implementation
- Frustum culling configuration
- Texture and model optimization

## Interactive Elements
### Hero Background Scene
- Particles system responding to mouse/touch
- Custom shaders for visual effects
- Animated geometry with GSAP integration
- Dynamic color scheme based on theme

### Project Showcases
- Interactive 3D models of projects
- Custom materials with theme awareness
- Animated transitions between states
- Touch/click interactions

### Skill Visualization
- 3D network/graph of skills
- Interactive nodes with information display
- Physics-based interactions
- Visual categorization of skill types

### Easter Eggs
- Hidden 3D interactions throughout site
- Special animations triggered by specific actions
- Secret areas accessible through interaction

## Technical Implementation
### Custom Shaders
```glsl
// Sample fragment shader for background
uniform float time;
uniform vec3 color;
uniform vec2 resolution;

void main() {
  vec2 st = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution;
  vec3 finalColor = color + 0.1 * sin(time + st.x * 10.0);
  gl_FragColor = vec4(finalColor, 1.0);
}
```

### Model Loading and Optimization
- Draco compression for models
- Progressive loading system
- Fallbacks during loading
- Error handling for WebGL issues

### Post-Processing
- Custom bloom effects
- Motion blur for animations
- Ambient occlusion for depth
- Color adjustments for theme consistency

### Responsive 3D
- Adaptive complexity based on device capability
- Different scenes for mobile vs desktop
- Touch-optimized controls for mobile
- Performance monitoring with fallback options
